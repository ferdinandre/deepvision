<b>How to Run Training and Evaluation:</b>

To get started, you'll need to replace the Kaggle API key in the first cell with your own. After that, simply run the cells in order.
The process will handle:
    Downloading the data,
    Unzipping the files,
    Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets,
    Applying data augmentation, normalization, and resizing.
    
Once the data preparation is complete, continue running the subsequent cells. These will:
    Import the model,
    Configure it for training,
    Train the model.
    
As you proceed, the script will generate:
    Training and validation accuracy and loss curves,
    A confusion matrix,
    And an ROC curve to evaluate the model's performance.
